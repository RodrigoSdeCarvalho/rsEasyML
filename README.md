# rsEasyML
Rust version of my machine learning framework that provides data preprocessing, feature selection, classification, regression and even more complex deep learning models, model persistence, autoencoders and anomaly detection

The idea of this project is to implement my already-working EasyML python lib in Rust, to both learn this amazing language and improve the lib's speed with a compiled language, as well as making use of its parallelism. 

For now, I'm still sharpening my Rust knowledge to actually write a well functioning library, and the practice code will be in the HelloWorld folder.
